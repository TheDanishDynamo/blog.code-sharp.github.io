# ubuntu failed to register alternate modes

If you ended up here I have bad news. Your Ubuntu installation is broken because you deleted a critical dependency. In my case I removed the version of python that was default in the distro, the removal cascaded into critical dependencies.  

The good news: You can recover data from the terminal, insert usb and mount it, copy files and folders.  

How to fix: Install a new copy of Ubuntu, format the partition.  

Tried:  

Boot Repair Tool : No good only related to boot - not usable  
Stack Overflow article on recover via various commands : No good  
Upgrade : No good - only formatting and installing a new works
